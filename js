What is JavaScript (JS)?
JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive.

Think of a static website as a skeleton. JavaScript adds life to it—it lets you interact with the page by clicking buttons, entering data, or seeing animations.

Simple Analogy:
A web page without JavaScript is like a toy car without batteries—you can see it, but you can't play with it.
JavaScript adds the batteries, making the car move and perform actions!

What Can JavaScript Do?
Here are a few things JavaScript can do:

Make the webpage interactive
Example: Clicking a button shows an alert or hides a section.
Respond to user actions
Example: When you type in a form, JavaScript checks if it's valid.
Create animations
Example: A menu slides in and out, or an image changes automatically.
Fetch data from servers
Example: Display live scores or weather updates without refreshing the page.
