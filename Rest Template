What is RestTemplate?
RestTemplate is a class in Spring that helps Java applications communicate with REST APIs. It acts like a browser or Postman but inside your code. You can use it to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and receive responses from web services.

Example:
Imagine you are building a weather app, and you need to get data from an external weather API. RestTemplate helps your Java application send a request and receive the weather data.

What is the Communicator Layer in RestTemplate?
The communicator layer is the part of your application that handles communication with external services using RestTemplate. It acts as a bridge between your app and the API.

Example:

Your app wants to fetch weather data → It calls the communicator layer
The communicator layer uses RestTemplate to send an API request
The API responds with weather data → The communicator layer processes and returns it to your app
This layer helps organize API calls separately, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
