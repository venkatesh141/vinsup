JUnit:
JUnit is a framework in Java used for writing and running tests for your code. Imagine you're building a house and 
want to make sure everything works—JUnit is like a checklist 
that helps you test different parts of your house (your code) to make sure they function correctly.

Unit Testing: It focuses on testing small parts (units) of your code, like a single method or class.
JUnit provides tools to easily create tests and check if your code works as expected.
For example, you might have a method that adds two numbers, and you want to make sure it adds them correctly.
JUnit helps you create a test that automatically checks this.

Mockito:
Mockito is a tool that helps you mock (fake) parts of your code that are difficult to test or interact with. 
It’s often used with JUnit to test certain pieces of code without 
needing the actual resources, like databases or web servers.

If you have a method that calls an external service (like sending an email), you don’t want to actually send an email during tests. 
Mockito lets you fake this behavior (mock the service), 
so the test runs quickly and doesn’t do anything unwanted (like sending real emails).
In simple terms, Mockito helps you create "mock" versions of objects to test the parts of your code that interact with them, 
without having to deal with real external systems.

Example:
JUnit: You want to test a calculateSum() method. JUnit helps you write the test.
Mockito: If calculateSum() relies on getting data from a database, you use Mockito to mock the database so the test doesn't depend 
on an actual database.
In short:

JUnit = framework for writing tests
Mockito = tool for faking parts of your code to make testing easier

Unit Testing:
Unit testing focuses on testing individual parts (or "units") of your code, usually functions or methods, to make sure they work correctly. 
Think of it like testing a single light bulb to see if it turns on when you flip the switch.

Smallest testable part: You’re testing just one piece of your code in isolation (like a function or method).
Objective: Make sure this small part of your code works as expected, and catches errors early on.
Example:
You have a function that adds two numbers together:

java
Copy
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
A unit test would check if the add() function works correctly with different inputs:

java
Copy
@Test
public void testAdd() {
    assertEquals(5, add(2, 3));  // Test if 2 + 3 equals 5
}
In this case, you're only testing that add() works in isolation, without worrying about any other code interacting with it.

Integration Testing:
Integration testing checks if multiple parts of your code work together correctly. Instead of testing a single function, 
you test how different pieces of your system interact with each other—like checking if the whole electrical system in a house works 
when you turn on multiple lights at once.

Larger scope: You test how different units (or pieces of code) work together.
Objective: Make sure that when different parts of the application are combined, they still function as expected.
Example:
If your add() function relies on fetching data from a database or external API, an integration test might check 
if the function still works when connected to the database. For example, it could test if you can successfully save and retrieve 
data from a database as part of the larger system.

Key Differences:
Unit Testing: Tests a single unit of your code (like one function or method) by itself.
Integration Testing: Tests how multiple parts of your code work together as a system.
In Simple Terms:
Unit Testing = Testing the small pieces (like testing each individual light bulb).
Integration Testing = Testing how those pieces work together (like checking the whole electrical system of the house).
Does that make sense? Let me know if you need more details!
