What is Spring Boot Actuator? (Simple Explanation)
Spring Boot Actuator is a tool that monitors and manages your Spring Boot application. It provides built-in endpoints to check the application's health, metrics, environment, and more.

Think of it Like This:
Imagine you are driving a car. 🚗
Your dashboard shows important information like speed, fuel level, and engine temperature.

Similarly, Spring Boot Actuator gives a dashboard for your application, showing details like:
✅ Is the application running?
✅ What is the memory usage?
✅ How many requests are being processed?
✅ What are the environment variables?

Why Use Actuator?
✅ Monitors application health 🏥
✅ Provides system metrics 📊
✅ Helps in debugging issues faster 🛠️
✅ Secures endpoints with authentication 🔐

🚀 Example: Using Actuator in Spring Boot
Step 1: Add Actuator Dependency
If you're using Maven, add this to your pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
For Gradle, add this to build.gradle:

gradle
Copy
Edit
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'
Step 2: Enable Actuator Endpoints
In application.properties, enable all endpoints:

properties
Copy
Edit
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
🔹 This allows you to access all built-in Actuator endpoints.

Step 3: Run and Test Actuator
Start your Spring Boot application and open these URLs in your browser:

1️⃣ Check if the app is running:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
✅ Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "status": "UP"
}
2️⃣ View application info:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
3️⃣ See memory usage, CPU, and more:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
🚀 Custom Actuator Endpoint (Example)
If you want to create your own custom Actuator endpoint, follow this:

Create a Custom Actuator Endpoint
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.Endpoint;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.ReadOperation;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Component
@Endpoint(id = "custominfo")
public class CustomActuatorEndpoint {

    @ReadOperation
    public Map<String, String> getCustomInfo() {
        Map<String, String> info = new HashMap<>();
        info.put("Application", "My Spring Boot App");
        info.put("Version", "1.0.0");
        return info;
    }
}
Test Your Custom Endpoint
Start your app and open:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080/actuator/custominfo
✅ Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Application": "My Spring Boot App",
  "Version": "1.0.0"
}
🌟 Summary
Spring Boot Actuator helps monitor and manage your app.
It provides built-in endpoints for health, metrics, and environment details.
You can enable/disable endpoints using application.properties.
You can create custom endpoints for custom application data.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Breaking it Down Step by Step
1️⃣ @Component
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
✅ What does it do?

Marks this class as a Spring Bean, so Spring can detect and use it.
🛠 Think of it like:

You are registering this class in Spring, so it can be used automatically.
2️⃣ @Endpoint(id = "custominfo")
java
Copy
Edit
@Endpoint(id = "custominfo")
✅ What does it do?

It creates a new Actuator endpoint with the name custominfo.
🔹 Now, you can access this endpoint using:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080/actuator/custominfo
🛠 Think of it like:

You are creating a new API in Actuator, which can be accessed through the browser or tools like Postman.
3️⃣ @ReadOperation
java
Copy
Edit
@ReadOperation
public Map<String, String> getCustomInfo() {
✅ What does it do?

It marks this method as a "GET request" endpoint.
When someone accesses /actuator/custominfo, this method runs and returns data.
🛠 Think of it like:

It’s similar to writing a @GetMapping in a Spring REST Controller.
4️⃣ Creating a Map to Store Data
java
Copy
Edit
Map<String, String> info = new HashMap<>();
info.put("Application", "My Spring Boot App");
info.put("Version", "1.0.0");
✅ What does it do?

It creates a map (key-value pair) to store data.
The map contains:
Application name ("My Spring Boot App")
Version ("1.0.0")
🛠 Think of it like:

You are creating a small database that stores details about your app.
5️⃣ Returning the Data
java
Copy
Edit
return info;
✅ What does it do?

It sends the map as a response when the endpoint is accessed.
🌟 Example Output
When you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/custominfo,
You will get this JSON response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Application": "My Spring Boot App",
  "Version": "1.0.0"
}
🔍 Final Summary
Annotation	What It Does?	Simple Explanation
@Component	Registers the class as a Spring Bean	Spring knows about this class and can use it
@Endpoint(id = "custominfo")	Creates a custom Actuator endpoint	You can access it via /actuator/custominfo
@ReadOperation	Defines a GET request method for the endpoint	It runs when someone visits /actuator/custominfo
Map<String, String>	Stores key-value data	Holds application details like name and version
return info;	Sends data as a response	Returns the stored information in JSON format
🎯 Why Use This?
Helps in monitoring and debugging applications.
You can add custom data like server info, database details, etc.
Can be used for logging and system checks.
