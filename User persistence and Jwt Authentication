User Persistence (Keeping Users Logged In)

User persistence means keeping a user logged in even after they close the app or browser. This way, they don’t have to enter their username and password every time.

    How It Works?
        Cookies – Small files stored in the browser that keep the session active.
        Sessions – Data stored on the server that remembers the user.
        Tokens (JWT) – Secure keys that allow users to stay logged in without storing passwords.

JWT Authentication (Secure Login Using Tokens)

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a way to securely authenticate users without storing their login state on the server.

    How It Works?
        User Logs In → They enter a username & password.
        Server Generates a JWT Token → A unique key (JWT) is created and sent to the user.
        User Stores the Token → The token is saved in local storage or cookies.
        User Makes a Request → Every time they visit a page, they send the JWT in the request.
        Server Verifies JWT → If the token is valid, the user is allowed access.

Why Use JWT?

✅ No Need to Store Sessions on the Server – Everything is in the token.
✅ Secure – It can be encrypted and verified.
✅ Fast Authentication – No need to check the database every time.
