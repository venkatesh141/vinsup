What is Microservices? (Simple Explanation)

Microservices is an architectural style where an application is broken down into small, independent services that communicate with each other. Each service is responsible for a specific feature and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Key Points:

    Each microservice has its own database and business logic.
    Microservices communicate using REST APIs or messaging queues.
    They allow easy scaling and maintenance compared to monolithic applications.

Example: Microservices in Java (Spring Boot)

Letâ€™s say we have an E-commerce Application with the following services:

    Product Service - Handles product details.
    Order Service - Manages orders.

Each microservice runs independently.
1. Product Service (Handles Product Details)

ðŸ‘‰ Runs on Port 8081
This service exposes an API to return product details.

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
public class ProductController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getProduct(@PathVariable int id) {
        return "Product Details for ID: " + id;
    }
}

2. Order Service (Handles Orders & Calls Product Service)

ðŸ‘‰ Runs on Port 8082
This service fetches product details from Product Service.

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public class OrderController {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String createOrder(@PathVariable int id) {
        String productDetails = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:8081/products/" + id, String.class);
        return "Order placed for: " + productDetails;
    }
}

ðŸ‘‰ Configuration for RestTemplate:
To allow Order Service to call Product Service, we need to configure RestTemplate:

@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
}

How They Work Together?

    Start the Product Service on port 8081.
    Start the Order Service on port 8082.
    Call the Order Service API:

http://localhost:8082/orders/101

Order Service calls Product Service internally and responds:

    Order placed for: Product Details for ID: 101

Advantages of Microservices

âœ… Independent Deployment â€“ No need to redeploy the entire application.
âœ… Scalability â€“ Scale each service separately.
âœ… Technology Flexibility â€“ Each service can use a different tech stack (Java, Python, etc.).
âœ… Fault Isolation â€“ If one service fails, others continue to work.
