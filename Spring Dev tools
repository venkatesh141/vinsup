What is Spring Boot DevTools? (Simple Explanation)
Spring Boot DevTools is a tool that helps developers by auto-restarting the application when code changes, making development faster and easier.

Think of it Like This:
Imagine you are writing a document, but every time you make a small change, you have to close and reopen the file to see the update. That would be annoying, right? 😩

Spring Boot DevTools removes this pain by automatically reloading your application whenever you make changes! 🚀

Why Use DevTools?
✅ Auto-restart: No need to stop & restart the app manually.
✅ LiveReload Support: Auto-refresh browser when frontend changes.
✅ Disables Caching: Helps in debugging by showing real-time changes.
✅ Works Only in Development: Won't affect production performance.

How to Use It?
1️⃣ Add DevTools to pom.xml (for Maven projects)
