Sure! Loops in Java are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition is met. Think of loops as a way to say, "Do this action again and again until I tell you to stop."

Types of Loops in Java
for Loop
Use this when you know how many times you want to repeat something.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
Explanation:
Start with i = 1.
Check if i <= 5. If true, print Count: i.
Increment i by 1 (i++), and repeat until i > 5.
while Loop
Use this when you donâ€™t know how many times the loop will run, but you have a condition to check.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
    i++;
}
Explanation:
Start with i = 1.
Check if i <= 5. If true, print Count: i.
Increment i by 1 and repeat until i > 5.
do-while Loop
Use this when you want the code to run at least once, even if the condition is false.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
Explanation:
Print Count: i and increment i by 1.
After running the code, check if i <= 5 and repeat if true.
Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you're eating cookies:

for loop: You have 5 cookies. You eat each cookie one by one and stop after the 5th.
while loop: You keep eating cookies as long as there are cookies left on the plate.
do-while loop: You eat one cookie first, then check if there are more to continue eating.
