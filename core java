Introduction to Java (Simple Explanation)
Java is a programming language used to create software applications. It is widely used because it is easy to learn, secure, and runs on many devices (computers, mobile phones, ATMs, etc.).

Key Points About Java:
High-Level Language – Java is written in a way that is easy for humans to understand.
Platform Independent – "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA). This means Java code can run on any system without modification.
Object-Oriented – Java follows the concept of objects and classes, making programs more structured and reusable.
Secure & Robust – Java has built-in security features and strong memory management.
Used Everywhere – Java is used for web applications, mobile apps (Android), banking systems, and more.
Simple Java Code Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!"); // Prints message
    }
}
Explanation:
public class HelloWorld → Defines a class named "HelloWorld".
public static void main(String[] args) → The main method where execution starts.
System.out.println("Hello, Java!"); → Prints "Hello, Java!" on the screen.

JDK, JVM, and JRE – Simple Explanation
Java works using three main components: JDK, JRE, and JVM. Let’s understand them step by step.

1️⃣ JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – "The Executor"
JVM is responsible for running Java programs.
It converts Java bytecode (machine-independent code) into machine code (understandable by your computer).
JVM is platform-dependent, meaning Windows, Linux, and macOS each have different JVMs.
🔹 Example: Imagine JVM as a translator that converts Java’s language into a language that your computer understands.

2️⃣ JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – "The Runner"
JRE contains JVM + essential libraries to run Java applications.
It does not include tools for writing Java programs (like the compiler).
If you just want to run Java applications (not develop), JRE is enough.
🔹 Example: If JVM is a translator, JRE is the complete package with the translator + necessary dictionaries to run a Java program.

3️⃣ JDK (Java Development Kit) – "The Creator"
JDK contains JRE + Development Tools (like compiler javac, debugger, etc.).
It is needed to write, compile, and run Java programs.
If you are a developer, you must install JDK.
🔹 Example: If JRE is just a dictionary for translation, JDK is a full office setup where you can write, compile, and run Java programs.

Simple Difference Table:
Feature	JVM (Java Virtual Machine)	JRE (Java Runtime Environment)	JDK (Java Development Kit)
Purpose	Runs Java programs	Runs Java programs	Develops + Runs Java programs
Contains	Only JVM	JVM + Libraries	JRE + Compiler + Debugger
Who Needs It?	Everyone running Java apps	End users running Java apps	Developers writing Java code
Conclusion:
If you just want to run Java applications → JRE is enough.
If you want to develop Java programs → You need JDK.
JVM is part of both JRE and JDK; it executes Java programs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure! Loops in Java are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition is met. Think of loops as a way to say, "Do this action again and again until I tell you to stop."

Types of Loops in Java
for Loop
Use this when you know how many times you want to repeat something.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
Explanation:
Start with i = 1.
Check if i <= 5. If true, print Count: i.
Increment i by 1 (i++), and repeat until i > 5.
while Loop
Use this when you don’t know how many times the loop will run, but you have a condition to check.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
    i++;
}
Explanation:
Start with i = 1.
Check if i <= 5. If true, print Count: i.
Increment i by 1 and repeat until i > 5.
do-while Loop
Use this when you want the code to run at least once, even if the condition is false.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
Explanation:
Print Count: i and increment i by 1.
After running the code, check if i <= 5 and repeat if true.
Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you're eating cookies:

for loop: You have 5 cookies. You eat each cookie one by one and stop after the 5th.
while loop: You keep eating cookies as long as there are cookies left on the plate.
do-while loop: You eat one cookie first, then check if there are more to continue eating.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
Variables and Data Types in Java (Simple Explanation)
1️⃣ What is a Variable?
A variable is like a container that stores data. In Java, every variable has a name, type, and value.

🔹 Example:

java
Copy
Edit
int age = 25;  // 'age' is a variable storing the value 25
Here,

int → Data type (stores whole numbers)
age → Variable name
25 → Value stored in the variable
2️⃣ Types of Variables in Java
Java has three types of variables:

Type	Description	Example
Local Variable	Declared inside a method and used only within it.	int x = 10; inside a method
Instance Variable	Declared inside a class but outside methods. Each object gets its own copy.	String name; inside a class
Static Variable	Shared across all objects of a class (declared using static).	static int count = 0;
3️⃣ Data Types in Java
Data types define what kind of values a variable can store. Java has two main types:

A. Primitive Data Types (8 types)
Data Type	Size	Stores	Example
byte	1 byte	Small whole numbers (-128 to 127)	byte b = 100;
short	2 bytes	Medium whole numbers (-32,768 to 32,767)	short s = 30000;
int	4 bytes	Large whole numbers (-2B to 2B)	int num = 100000;
long	8 bytes	Very large whole numbers	long bigNum = 9999999999L;
float	4 bytes	Decimal numbers (less precision)	float pi = 3.14f;
double	8 bytes	Decimal numbers (high precision)	double precisePi = 3.141592;
char	2 bytes	Single character	char letter = 'A';
boolean	1 bit	true or false values	boolean isJavaFun = true;
B. Non-Primitive Data Types (Objects, Strings, Arrays, etc.)
Data Type	Example
String	String name = "Venkatesh";
Array	int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
Class	class Car {}
4️⃣ Example Program:
java
Copy
Edit
public class DataTypeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 25;  // Integer variable
        double price = 99.99;  // Decimal variable
        char grade = 'A';  // Character variable
        boolean isPassed = true;  // Boolean variable
        String name = "Venkatesh";  // String (non-primitive)

        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
        System.out.println("Passed: " + isPassed);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
    }
}
5️⃣ Summary
Variables store data in Java.
Primitive types (8) store simple values like numbers and characters.
Non-primitive types store complex objects like Strings and Arrays.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Bitwise operators 


e operators in Java with their explanations and examples:
1. Bitwise AND (&)

    Performs a binary AND operation. The result is 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.

Example:

int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int b = 3; // 0011 in binary
int result = a & b; // 0001 (1 in decimal)
System.out.println(result); // Output: 1

2. Bitwise OR (|)

    Performs a binary OR operation. The result is 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.

Example:

int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int b = 3; // 0011 in binary
int result = a | b; // 0111 (7 in decimal)
System.out.println(result); // Output: 7

3. Bitwise XOR (^)

    Performs a binary XOR operation. The result is 1 if the corresponding bits are different.

Example:

int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int b = 3; // 0011 in binary
int result = a ^ b; // 0110 (6 in decimal)
System.out.println(result); // Output: 6

4. Bitwise Complement (~)

    Inverts all the bits of a number (1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1).

Example:

int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int result = ~a; // 1010 (2's complement: -6 in decimal)
System.out.println(result); // Output: -6


Left Shift Shortcut

    Left shift (<<) is equivalent to multiplying a number by 2n2n (where nn is the number of positions shifted).

Shortcut: Instead of:

int result = num << n; // num * 2^n

You can simply use:

int result = num * (1 << n);

Example:

int num = 3; // 0011 in binary
int n = 2;   // Shift left by 2 positions
int result = num << n; // Same as 3 * 2^2 = 12
System.out.println(result); // Output: 12

Right Shift Shortcut

    Right shift (>>) is equivalent to dividing a number by 2n2n (for positive numbers).

Shortcut: Instead of:

int result = num >> n; // num / 2^n

You can simply use:

int result = num / (1 << n);

Example:

int num = 16; // 10000 in binary
int n = 2;    // Shift right by 2 positions
int result = num >> n; // Same as 16 / 2^2 = 4
System.out.println(result); // Output: 4

Exception handling 


Exception Handling in Simple Terms
Imagine you are withdrawing money from an ATM. If you enter an amount greater than your account balance, the ATM shows an error message instead of crashing. This is similar to exception handling in Java—it helps prevent a program from crashing when something unexpected happens.

What is an Exception?
An exception is an error that occurs during program execution. If not handled, it stops the program.

Example of an exception:

java
Copy
Edit
int a = 10;
int b = 0;
int c = a / b; // This will cause an error (ArithmeticException)
Since division by zero is not allowed, the program will crash.

How to Handle Exceptions?
We use try, catch, and finally blocks.

try – The risky code goes inside this block.
catch – Catches and handles the exception.
finally – Runs whether an exception occurs or not (optional).
Example: Handling Division by Zero
java
Copy
Edit
public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int a = 10;
            int b = 0;
            int c = a / b; // Risky code
            System.out.println(c);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues...");
    }
}
Output:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
Program continues...
Without exception handling, the program would crash. With exception handling, it displays an error message and continues execution.

Types of Exceptions
Checked Exceptions – Must be handled (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
Unchecked Exceptions – Occur at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException).
Using finally
java
Copy
Edit
try {
    int num = 5 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e);
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block always executes.");
}
Throwing Custom Exceptions
You can create your own exception using throw.

java
Copy
Edit
class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 15;
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("You must be 18 or older.");
        }
        System.out.println("You are eligible.");
    }
}
Output:

cpp
Copy
Edit
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: You must be 18 or older.
Summary
Exceptions help prevent program crashes.
Use try-catch to handle errors.
finally always executes.
throw creates custom exceptions.

Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions in Simple Terms
In Java, exceptions are divided into two types:

Checked Exceptions – These must be handled at compile-time.
Unchecked Exceptions – These occur at runtime and can be avoided by writing proper code.
1. Checked Exceptions (Compile-Time Exceptions)
These exceptions are checked by the compiler.
If not handled, the program won’t compile.
Examples: IOException, SQLException, InterruptedException.
Example: Handling Checked Exception
Let’s say we are trying to read a file. If the file is missing, a FileNotFoundException occurs.

java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("nonexistent.txt"); // The file does not exist
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file); // Risky code
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
            }
            scanner.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: File not found!");
        }
    }
}
Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Error: File not found!
☑️ Since FileNotFoundException is a checked exception, Java forces us to handle it using try-catch.

2. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)
These are not checked at compile-time.
They occur due to logic errors in the code.
Examples: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Example: Unchecked Exception
java
Copy
Edit
public class UncheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(numbers[5]); // Accessing index that doesn’t exist
    }
}
Output:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 5 out of bounds for length 3
🔴 Since this is an unchecked exception, Java does not force us to handle it, but if it occurs, the program will crash.

Key Differences Between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
Feature	Checked Exception	Unchecked Exception
Checked at Compile Time?	Yes	No
Handling Required?	Yes, must use try-catch or throws	No, but recommended
Examples	IOException, SQLException, InterruptedException	ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Cause	External factors (file not found, network failure)	Logical errors in code
Summary
Checked Exceptions → Must be handled (try-catch), like file operations.
Unchecked Exceptions → Occur at runtime, like division by zero.

Packages


Packages in Java (Simple Explanation)
What is a Package?
A package in Java is like a folder that organizes related Java files together. It helps to:
✅ Avoid name conflicts
✅ Make code reusable and manageable
✅ Provide access control

Example: Why Use Packages?
Imagine you have two classes named Student—one for school records and another for college records. Without packages, Java gets confused.

✅ Solution? Put them in different packages.

Copy
Edit
school.Student
college.Student
How to Create and Use Packages?
1. Creating a Package
Use the package keyword at the top of the Java file.

java
Copy
Edit
package mypackage;  // Package name

public class Hello {
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello from mypackage!");
    }
}
📌 Save this file as Hello.java inside a folder named mypackage.

2. Using a Package in Another Class
To use a class from a package, we use import.

java
Copy
Edit
import mypackage.Hello;  // Import the Hello class from mypackage

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Hello obj = new Hello();
        obj.sayHello();
    }
}
Types of Packages
1️⃣ Built-in Packages – Java’s pre-defined packages (e.g., java.util, java.io)
2️⃣ User-defined Packages – Custom packages created by developers

Example: Built-in Package (java.util)
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.Scanner; // Importing Scanner class

public class BuiltInExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}
Summary
✅ Packages are like folders that organize Java classes.
✅ Use package to define a package.
✅ Use import to use a class from another package.
✅ Java has built-in packages (like java.util) and user-defined packages.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Exception Handling in Java (Simple Explanation)
What is an Exception?
An exception is an unexpected event that happens during program execution, causing the program to stop abnormally. Example:

Dividing a number by zero
Accessing an invalid index in an array
Opening a file that doesn’t exist
What is Exception Handling?
Exception handling is a way to handle errors so that the program doesn’t crash. Instead of stopping, we can catch the error and show a meaningful message or take an alternative action.

How to Handle Exceptions in Java?
1. Using try and catch
We write code inside a try block. If an exception occurs, it is caught in the catch block.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int num = 10 / 0;  // This will cause an exception (division by zero)
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues...");
    }
}
Output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Cannot divide by zero!
Program continues...
Even though an error happened, the program did not stop because we handled it using try-catch.

2. Using finally (Optional)
The finally block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int num = 10 / 0;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This will always execute.");
        }
    }
}
Output:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Cannot divide by zero!
This will always execute.
3. Using throws (Telling the Method to Handle Exception)
If a method might cause an exception, we tell Java using throws.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class ThrowsExample {
    static void divide() throws ArithmeticException {
        int num = 10 / 0;  // This causes an exception
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            divide();
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception handled in main.");
        }
    }
}
Output:

css
Copy
Edit
Exception handled in main.
4. Using throw (Manually Creating an Exception)
If we want to manually throw an exception, we use throw.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class ThrowExample {
    static void checkAge(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible to vote.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You can vote.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        checkAge(16);  // This will throw an exception
    }
}
Output:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Not eligible to vote.
Types of Exceptions
1. Checked Exceptions (Compile-Time Exceptions)
These exceptions are checked by the compiler. We must handle them using try-catch or throws.
Examples:

IOException (When working with files)
SQLException (When working with databases)
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("test.txt");  // File may not exist
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(file);
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found!");
        }
    }
}
2. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)
These exceptions occur at runtime and are not checked by the compiler.
Examples:

ArithmeticException (Divide by zero)
NullPointerException (Accessing an object that is null)
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (Accessing an invalid index in an array)
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class UncheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(arr[5]);  // Invalid index
    }
}
Output:

cpp
Copy
Edit
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
3. Custom Exceptions (User-Defined Exceptions)
We can create our own exceptions by extending the Exception class.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class CustomExceptionExample {
    static void checkNumber(int num) throws MyException {
        if (num < 0) {
            throw new MyException("Negative number not allowed.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Valid number.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkNumber(-5);
        } catch (MyException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
Output:

typescript
Copy
Edit
Negative number not allowed.
Key Points to Remember
Use try-catch to handle exceptions.
finally always executes, even if an exception occurs.
Use throws to declare exceptions in methods.
Use throw to manually throw exceptions.
Checked exceptions must be handled. Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime.
We can create custom exceptions by extending the Exception class.

Break and Continue in Java (Simple Explanation)
1️⃣ break Statement
Stops the loop immediately when a condition is met.
Exits the loop completely.
Example: Stop printing numbers when 5 is found
java
Copy
Edit
public class BreakExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                break;  // Stops the loop when i = 5
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
Output:

Copy
Edit
1  
2  
3  
4  🔹 The loop stops when `i ==

2️⃣ continue Statement
Skips the current iteration when a condition is met.
Does NOT exit the loop, it just moves to the next iteration.
Example: Skip printing 5 but continue the loop
java
Copy
Edit
public class ContinueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                continue;  // Skips when i = 5 and moves to the next iteration
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
Output:

Copy
Edit
1  
2  
3  
4  
6  
7  
8  
9  
10  
🔹 5 is skipped, but the loop continues running for other numbers.

Package 
Packages in Java (Simple Explanation)
A package in Java is like a folder that helps organize your Java files (classes, interfaces, etc.). It groups similar types of classes together, making the code structured, reusable, and easy to manage.

Why Use Packages?
Avoids Name Conflicts – Two classes can have the same name if they are in different packages.
Organizes Code – Helps keep related classes together.
Provides Access Control – Some classes can be hidden from other packages.
Reusability – We can use existing packages in multiple projects.
Types of Packages in Java
Built-in Packages – These are already available in Java (e.g., java.util, java.io).
User-defined Packages – Created by programmers to organize their own code.
How to Create a Package?
Declare a package at the top of the Java file
Save the file in a folder with the same package name
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
package mypackage;  // Creating a package named "mypackage"

public class Hello {
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from mypackage!");
    }
}
How to Use a Package?
To use a class from another package, we use the import keyword.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import mypackage.Hello;  // Importing the Hello class from "mypackage"

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Hello obj = new Hello();  // Creating an object of Hello
        obj.greet();  // Calling the method
    }
}
Common Built-in Packages
java.util → For utility classes (e.g., ArrayList, Scanner).
java.io → For input/output operations (e.g., reading/writing files).
java.net → For network-related operations.

Access Modifiers in Java (Simple Explanation)

Access modifiers in Java control who can access a class, method, or variable. They help in data security and encapsulation (hiding details from other parts of the code).
Types of Access Modifiers
Modifier	Where it can be accessed?	Used in?
public	Anywhere (inside or outside the class, package, or project)	Class, Method, Variable
private	Only inside the same class	Method, Variable
protected	Inside the same package + subclasses (even in different packages)	Method, Variable
(default)	Only inside the same package (No keyword used)	Class, Method, Variable
Examples
1. public (Accessible Everywhere)

package mypackage;

public class Example {
    public int num = 10; // Public variable
}

import mypackage.Example;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        System.out.println(obj.num); // ✅ Accessible
    }
}

2. private (Accessible Only Inside the Same Class)

class Example {
    private int num = 10; // Private variable

    private void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }

    public void display() {
        show(); // ✅ Allowed inside the same class
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        // System.out.println(obj.num);  ❌ Not Allowed (private)
        // obj.show();  ❌ Not Allowed (private)
        obj.display(); // ✅ Allowed (indirect access)
    }
}

3. protected (Accessible in the Same Package + Subclasses in Other Packages)

package mypackage;

class Example {
    protected int num = 20; // Protected variable
}

import mypackage.Example;

class Test extends Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = new Test();
        System.out.println(obj.num); // ✅ Accessible (subclass)
    }
}

4. Default (No Keyword, Accessible Only in the Same Package)

package mypackage;

class Example { // Default access (no modifier)
    int num = 30; // Default variable
}

package anotherpackage;

import mypackage.Example;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        // System.out.println(obj.num); ❌ Not Allowed (different package)
    }
}

Quick Summary
Modifier	Same Class	Same Package	Subclass (Other Package)	Other Packages
public	✅	✅	✅	✅
private	✅	❌	❌	❌
protected	✅	✅	✅	❌
(default)	✅	✅	❌	❌

static in Java (Simple Explanation)
The static keyword in Java means "shared" or "belongs to the class, not to an object."

When something is static, it belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects. This means:

You don’t need to create an object to access it.
It is shared among all objects of the class.
Where Can We Use static?
Static Variables (shared across all objects)
Static Methods (can be called without creating an object)
Static Blocks (runs only once when the class is loaded)
Static Classes (nested classes that don’t need an outer class instance)
1. Static Variables (Class Variables)
A static variable is shared among all objects of the class.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Example {
    static int count = 0; // Shared among all objects

    Example() {
        count++; // Increases when an object is created
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj1 = new Example();
        Example obj2 = new Example();
        Example obj3 = new Example();

        System.out.println(Example.count); // Output: 3 (same for all)
    }
}
✅ Even if we create multiple objects, count is shared and updated for all.

2. Static Methods
A static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object.
It cannot access non-static variables (because non-static variables belong to objects, and objects may not exist yet).
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Example {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello from a static method!");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example.show(); // No object needed
    }
}
✅ We called show() without creating an object!

🚫 Static methods CANNOT use non-static variables directly.

java
Copy
Edit
class Example {
    int num = 10; // Non-static variable

    static void show() {
        System.out.println(num); // ❌ ERROR (non-static variable)
    }
}
✔ Fix: Use a static variable or create an object.

java
Copy
Edit
class Example {
    static int num = 10; // Static variable

    static void show() {
        System.out.println(num); // ✅ Allowed
    }
}
3. Static Block (Runs Once When Class Loads)
A static block runs only once when the class is first loaded into memory.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Example {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block executed!"); // Runs only once
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj1 = new Example();
        Example obj2 = new Example();
    }
}
✅ Output:

scss
Copy
Edit
Static block executed!
(Even if we create multiple objects, the static block runs only once.)

4. Static Nested Class (Doesn’t Need Outer Class Instance)
A static class inside another class can be used without creating an object of the outer class.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Outer {
    static class Inner {
        void show() {
            System.out.println("Static inner class method");
        }
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner(); // No need for Outer object
        obj.show();
    }
}
Quick Summary
static Feature	What it Does?
Static Variable	Shared among all objects (single copy)
Static Method	Can be called without an object
Static Block	Runs once when the class is loaded
Static Class	Inner class that doesn’t need an outer class instance
