What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a way for two software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant:

You (the client) request food from the menu.
The waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server).
The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter.
The waiter brings the food back to you.
Similarly, an API allows a client (such as a website or mobile app) to request data from a server and get a response.

What is a REST API?
REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that follows certain rules to make communication easier. It mainly uses HTTP methods like:

GET â†’ To retrieve data
POST â†’ To send data (like submitting a form)
PUT â†’ To update existing data
DELETE â†’ To remove data
Example of a REST API request:
If you want to get details of a user from a website, you can call:

ruby
Copy
Edit
GET https://example.com/api/users/1
This will return user details in a structured format like JSON:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Venkatesh",
  "email": "venkatesh@example.com"
}
This is how REST APIs help applications talk to each other in a simple and organized way! ðŸš€
