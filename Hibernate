Hibernate is a Java framework that helps you interact with databases more easily.

Why do we need Hibernate?
Normally, when you work with databases in Java, you have to write a lot of SQL queries manually. This can be tedious, error-prone, and difficult to manage.
Hibernate simplifies this by allowing you to work with Java objects instead of writing SQL queries directly.

How does Hibernate work?
It maps Java objects to database tables – You create a Java class, and Hibernate links it to a table in the database.
It generates SQL queries automatically – Instead of writing SQL manually, Hibernate does it for you.
It manages database connections – You don’t have to worry about opening and closing connections manually.
Example
Without Hibernate:

java
Copy
Edit
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
With Hibernate:

java
Copy
Edit
User user = session.get(User.class, 1);
You avoid writing SQL, and Hibernate takes care of fetching data.

Key Features of Hibernate
✅ Reduces manual SQL writing
✅ Works with multiple databases
✅ Provides caching for better performance
✅ Manages relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, etc.)
